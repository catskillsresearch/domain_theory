# Continuous lattice constructions (Scott 1972, §2.8–2.12)

The Milner correction (March 1972, pp. 135–136) is in `MilnerCorrection.lean`. Full proofs of
2.8–2.12 under `CoarserThanScottTopology` are the remaining 1972 items; the Sierpiński
injectivity base case (1.2) is already complete.

This file additionally proves Scott's first two example/closure results, the order-theoretic
content of Propositions 2.8 (finite lattices are continuous) and 2.9 (products of continuous
lattices are continuous). The accompanying topological claims of 2.9–2.10 ("the induced
topology agrees with the product / subspace topology") are the parts that require the Milner
correction and remain open.

/-- A non-empty **finite** directed set attains its supremum: `⊔S ∈ S`. A maximal element of
`S` (which exists by finiteness) is, by directedness, the greatest element, hence the
supremum. This is the order-theoretic heart of "finite ⟹ continuous" (Scott 1972, 2.8). -/

/-- **Scott 1972, Proposition 2.8.** A finite lattice is a continuous lattice. In a finite
lattice every principal up-set `Set.Ici y` is Scott-open (a non-empty directed set is finite,
so it attains its supremum), hence `y ≪ y`; therefore `y` is the supremum of `{x | x ≪ y}`. -/

/-- **Scott 1972, Proposition 2.9 (order-theoretic content).** The Cartesian product of any
family of continuous lattices is a continuous lattice.

The key step is that if `a ≪ yᵢ` in the factor `Dᵢ`, then the cylinder element `[a]ⁱ`
(equal to `a` in coordinate `i` and `⊥` elsewhere) is way below `y` in the product: the
preimage `{z | zᵢ ∈ U}` of a Scott-open witness `U ⊆ Dᵢ` is Scott-open in the product
(suprema are computed coordinatewise). Any upper bound `b` of `{x | x ≪ y}` therefore
dominates every `[a]ⁱ`, so `a = ([a]ⁱ)ᵢ ≤ bᵢ`; ranging over `a ≪ yᵢ` and using continuity of
`Dᵢ` gives `yᵢ ≤ bᵢ` for all `i`, i.e. `y ≤ b`. -/

/-! ### Proposition 2.11: continuous lattices are injective

The substance of Scott's Theorem 2.12. We give the explicit extension operator
`g(y) = ⊔_{V ∋ y open} ⊓ f''(e⁻¹V)` and prove (a) it extends `f` along an embedding `e`
(using continuity of `D` to interpolate from below) and (b) it is Scott-continuous (using the
`↟a` basis of the Scott topology). -/

/-- Scott's canonical extension of `f : X → E` along `e : X → Y` (Scott 1972, proof of 2.11):
`y ↦ ⊔ { ⊓ f''(e⁻¹V) : V an open neighbourhood of y }`. No topology on `E` is needed to *state*
the operator — it is purely order-theoretic. -/

  ⟨_, Set.univ, isOpen_univ, Set.mem_univ y, rfl⟩

/-- The defining family of `scottExtend` is directed: open neighbourhoods are closed under
intersection, and `⊓ f''(e⁻¹ ·)` is monotone in the neighbourhood (smaller set, larger inf). -/

  · exact sInf_le_sInf (Set.image_mono (Set.preimage_mono Set.inter_subset_right))

/-- The extension agrees with `f` on the (embedded) subspace. The `≤` direction is immediate
(`f x₀` is one of the values being met); the `≥` direction uses continuity of `E`: for each
`a ≪ f x₀` the Scott-open `↟a` pulls back along the continuous `f` and, by the embedding, to an
open `V ⊆ Y` on whose `e`-preimage `f ≥ a`, so `a ≤ ⊓ f''(e⁻¹V) ≤ g(e x₀)`. -/

/-- The extension is Scott-continuous. For a Scott-open `U` and a point `y₀` with `g y₀ ∈ U`, the
basis lemma gives `a ≪ g y₀` with `↟a ⊆ U`; since `g y₀` is a directed supremum, `a ≪ ⊓ f''(e⁻¹V)`
for some open `V ∋ y₀`, and that value is `≤ g y'` for every `y' ∈ V`, so `V ⊆ g⁻¹U`. -/
