# Neighborhood systems (Scott 1981, PRG-19, §1) — foundations

Following Dana Scott, *Lectures on a Mathematical Theory of Computation*, Technical
Monograph PRG-19, Oxford (May 1981), Lecture I, *Domains given by neighbourhoods*.

Scott fixes a non-empty set `Δ` of *tokens* and considers a family `𝒟` of subsets of `Δ`
(the *neighbourhoods*). The order is *reversed* relative to information: a **smaller**
neighbourhood carries **more** information. A finite sequence of neighbourhoods is
*consistent* when it has a common lower bound inside `𝒟` (a `Z ∈ 𝒟` contained in all of
them); a neighbourhood system is closed under intersections of consistent finite sequences.

This file formalizes the very first page of §1:

* **Definition 1.1** — `NeighborhoodSystem`: a family with `Δ ∈ 𝒟` (condition (i)) and
  closure under consistent binary intersections (condition (ii)).
* **Factoid 1.1a / 1.1b** — Scott's recursive *convention* for the finite intersection
  `⋂_{i < n} Xᵢ` (`interUpTo`): the empty intersection is `Δ`, and the `(n+1)`-fold
  intersection peels off the last factor.
* **Theorem 1.1c** — "from (ii) we can extend the intersection property to any finite
  sequence", and *consequently* a finite sequence is consistent **iff** its intersection
  lies in `𝒟`.

The §1 core is deliberately **constructive**: Scott uses *partial* filters so that the
basic theory avoids maximal-filter existence (Zorn/choice). Every theorem here depends only
on `propext`/`Quot.sound` (no `Classical.choice`).

namespace Domain.Neighborhood

/-- **Definition 1.1 (Scott 1981, PRG-19).** A *neighbourhood system* over a token type
`α`. `mem X` means "`X` is a neighbourhood" (`X ∈ 𝒟`), and `master` is Scott's least
informative neighbourhood `Δ` (the whole token set, "ask me no questions").

The two conditions are exactly Scott's:

* (i)  `Δ ∈ 𝒟`                                        — `master_mem`;
* (ii) whenever `X, Y, Z ∈ 𝒟` and `Z ⊆ X ∩ Y`, then `X ∩ Y ∈ 𝒟` — `inter_mem`.

We keep `master` as a field (rather than hard-wiring `Set.univ`) to stay faithful to
Scott's `Δ` notation. -/

/-- The finite intersection `⋂_{i < n} Xᵢ` of the first `n` terms of a sequence of
neighbourhoods, defined by Scott's recursive convention (**Factoid 1.1a / 1.1b**):

* `n = 0` : the empty intersection is `Δ` (`master`);
* `n + 1` : `(⋂_{i < n} Xᵢ) ∩ Xₙ`.

/-- The finite intersection is contained in each of its factors: `⋂_{i < n} Xᵢ ⊆ Xⱼ` for
`j < n`. (Supporting lemma: this is what makes `⋂_{i < n} Xᵢ` a common lower bound of the
sequence, the intuition behind consistency.) -/

/-- A finite sequence `X₀, …, Xₙ₋₁` of neighbourhoods is *consistent in* `𝒟` when it has a
common lower bound inside `𝒟`: some `Z ∈ 𝒟` contained in the intersection `⋂_{i < n} Xᵢ`
(equivalently, contained in every `Xⱼ`, `j < n`). This is Scott's notion of consistency,
generalized from pairs to finite sequences. -/
def Consistent (X : ℕ → Set α) (n : ℕ) : Prop :=

/-- **Theorem 1.1c (extension of the intersection property).** Scott: "from (ii), we can
extend the intersection property to any finite sequence." If `Xᵢ ∈ 𝒟` for every `i < n`
and the sequence is consistent, then the finite intersection `⋂_{i < n} Xᵢ` is again a
neighbourhood (`∈ 𝒟`). Proved by induction on `n`; the inductive step is one application of
condition (ii). -/

/-- **Theorem 1.1c (consistency characterization).** "Consequently, `X₀, …, Xₙ₋₁` is
consistent in `𝒟` iff `⋂_{i < n} Xᵢ ∈ 𝒟`." (Given `Xᵢ ∈ 𝒟` for all `i < n`.)

* `→` is the extension property `interUpTo_mem`;
* `←` is immediate: the intersection is its own common lower bound. -/
